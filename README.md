# es6-express-mongoose-starter 
This repo serves as an starter package written in JavaScript (ES6) for anyone looking to get up and running with Express and Mongoose fast. It contains a example REST API for fictious todos connected to MongoDB and uses [Mocha]("https://mochajs.org/")/[Chai]("http://chaijs.com/") for the unit tests.

- Best practices in file and application organization
- Ready to go build system for working with ES6
- Uses [Eslint]("http://eslint.org/") for code linting
- Example of REST API connected to MongoDB (by Mongoose)
- Example unit tests created with [Mocha]("https://mochajs.org/")/[Chai]("http://chaijs.com/") and [Mockgoose]("https://github.com/mockgoose/mockgoose")

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- [Node.js]("https://nodejs.org/") >= 6.x
- [MongoDB]("https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/")

### Clone project & install dependencies
```bash
$ git clone git://github.com/patrickvaler/es6-express-mongoose-starter ./my-example-app
$ cd my-example-app

$ yarn install
  OR
$ npm install
```

### Initialize MongoDB with data
> The server tries to connect with `'mongodb://localhost:27017/es6-express-mongoose-starter'`, you can overwrite this default setting for each environment in `src/config/config.js`.

Connect to your MongoDB instance and insert:
```bash
$ use es6-express-mongoose-starter
$ db.todos.insert([{ name: 'Book flight to Los Angeles' },
                   { name: 'Reserve a table at a chinese restaurant' },
                   { name: 'Buy birthday present for Tom' },
                   { name: 'Book flight to Los Angeles' }]);
```

### Run backend
```bash
$ npm run serve
```
Runs the application with [nodemon]("https://nodemon.io/"). Server is listening on Port 3000 by default, you can overwrite this default setting for each environment in `src/config/config.js`

Test if the backend is running by `curl` or a tool like [Postman]("https://www.getpostman.com/"):
```bash
$ curl localhost:3000/api/v1
```
It should return the current version of the package.json file.

> All available routes of this starter package can be found [below](#availableRoutes) or in `src/config/routes.js`.

## Additional information
### <a name="availableRoutes">Available routes</a>

**Get a list of Todos**
```
GET localhost:3000/api/v1/todo
```

**Add a Todo**
```
POST localhost:3000/api/v1/todo

Body: {
    name: String
}
```

**Update a Todo**
```
PUT localhost:3000/api/v1/todo/:id

Body: {
    name: String
}
```

**Delete a Todo**
```
DELETE localhost:3000/api/v1/todo/:id
```

### Scripts
**Run for development**
```bash
$ npm run serve
```
Runs the application with [nodemon]("https://nodemon.io/"). Server is listening on Port 3000 by default, this can be overwritten by `API_PORT` constant in `src/config/config.js`. Application will automatically run babel and eslint and restart if a code change was detected.

**Build**
```bash
$ npm run build
```
Runs eslint, transpiles the ES6 code and copies the transpiled code into build folder.

**Test**
```bash
$ npm test
```
Runs eslint and verifies the unit tests from `test/` folder;

### Eslint
 is pre-configured for this starter package. It uses the airbnb configuration package and a minimal set of own rules. Configuration is available in `.eslintrc.js`.

### Unit-Tests
A set of unit tests is available in `test/` folder. [Mocha]("https://mochajs.org/")/[Chai]("http://chaijs.com/") was used to create and run the unit tests.
